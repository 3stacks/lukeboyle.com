(perhaps in solidarity for the thousands of banned conservative and right wing accounts). The only problem is, they don't understand that 
this is what they have been advocating for the entire time. Remember, "freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences". This should 
be a time for people across the spectrum to unite against Twitter's suppression of free speech, however, the #StopTheLeftPurge tag is filled 
with gloating right wingers and braindead left wingers claiming they're being singled out. Vote with your wallets lefties, join Parler and let Twitter 
wither until they provide an equal platform for all viewpoints`

the 5G? Surely they would like to recoup some of
the $48.7bn [[1]](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/nbn-rollout-cost-to-jump-by-2-billion-20180831-p500yw.html) they've invested into the abject failure that is
the NBN. All you need to do is look at Telstra's
official speed metrics between their supported
broadband technologies to see that NBN is a bad
service.

|     |  Peak Speed  | Latency |
| --- | ------------ | ------- |
|  4G | 100-300 Mbps | 50ms |
| 5G | 1-20 Gbps | 1-6ms |
| NBN | 12-100 Mbps | may vary |

Table data: [[2]](https://telstraventures.com/5g-australia-how-it-affects-businesses).

Expected median speed in San Francisco (under average load) market is 1.4Gbps with latency of 4.9ms [[3]](https://www.whistleout.com.au/MobilePhones/Guides/5g-in-australia-what-you-need-to-know)

If it came out that this was the case then I
wouldn't be surprised if they were also
responsible for the proliferation of 5G
conspiracy theories`
