Agander started in November 2015 with a vision to unify several of the
productivity services I use. With Agander I could now have one tab where
previously I had four or five. This post is fairly overdue, but I think it's
worth taking the time to appreciate how far the project has come. While I did
start in November, the biggest progress didn't start until January 2016.
Working a 9-5 job and then coming home to work on Agander until 1AM has been
a struggle, but the outcome is the true reward. As of Version 0.1 in December
(with vaporware calendar) As of Version 1.0 on March 19th - Agander has now
entered a brief period of refactoring and optimisation, after which point, the
next set of integrations will be developed to create a more comprehensive
platform.
