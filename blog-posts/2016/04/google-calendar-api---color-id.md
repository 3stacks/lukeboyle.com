When you request aÂ Google Calendar event it will come with a colorId which is either undefined if user didn't select a colour, or between one and 11 if they did. Since I needed these for Agander, I decided to collate these for the curious. These are the corresponding colours used in the Google Calendar app.

| Color ID  | Color Name | Hex Code | Sample |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| undefined | Who knows  | #039be5  |        |
| 1         | Lavender   | #7986cb  |        |
| 2         | Sage       | #33b679  |        |
| 3         | Grape      | #8e24aa  |        |
| 4         | Flamingo   | #e67c73  |        |
| 5         | Banana     | #f6c026  |        |
| 6         | Tangerine  | #f5511d  |        |
| 7         | Peacock    | #039be5  |        |
| 8         | Graphite   | #616161  |        |
| 9         | Blueberry  | #3f51b5  |        |
| 10        | Basil      | #0b8043  |        |
| 11        | Tomato     | #d60000  |        |
