The influx of these MC/Producer partnerships is producing some
amazing albums. I compare it to Hollywood films. In most of these
productions, a screenwriter produces a screenplay and then hands it
off to a director to shoot it.

There's nothing wrong with that approach, but it's nice when a
talented writer gets a chance to direct the film they've written.
You find that the tone and visuals seem to make a lot more sense
(e.g. Joel Edgerton with The Gift, James Gunn with Guardians of the Galaxy).

Similarly, when a talented producer and MC team up, the end product
is usually a more consistent, interesting, and enjoyable experience.

Look no further than:

-   Madvillainy - Madvillain
-   Pinata/Bandana - MadGibbs
-   Hella Personal Film Festival - Open Mike Eagle & Paul White
-   Doggystyle - Snoop Doggy Dogg
-   R.A.P Music - Killer Mike & El-P
-   Yes Lawd - NxWorries

And then there's this album. This was certainly the most surprising
album of the year. billy woods hasn't been on my radar since
_Today I Wrote Nothing_ (2015). For me, _Known Unknowns_ (2017,
produced by BLOCKHEAD) didn't have the same hook that _Hiding Places_ has.

One of my favourite parts of this album is the simple, muted melodies
from Ryan Crosby's guitar.

billy wood's vocal style walks the line between spoken word poem and a
conventional rap verse. This style can be disorienting to
listen to, but when combined with the gloomy, subtle beats -
underscored by Ryan Crosby's muted guitar melodies - it becomes
something truly great.

The ever-present themes in this album are 1. class and 2. poverty, but
it doesn't try to shove them down your throat. Whereas in some albums
these themes can come across as overly heavy-handed, _Hiding Places_
seems to accept that these problems exist and tries to work through
the anxiety that comes with them, rather than to prescribe change.

This message comes peaks a the half way point in _A day in a Week in a Year_.
The title seems to mean that this day is just like any other; nothing
happens and nothing really changes. This is reinforced by these
lyrics in verse 1:

> A day, in a week, in a year
>
> Where e'rything exactly as you feared
>
> Lightning could strike me right here
>
> The rest of my lie I'ma be like, "Yo, I was standin' right there."

For billy woods it's certainly more about the pursuit of creating art
than fame, money, or material wealth.
Given his consistency with producing high quality, honest music, he
deserves to be a little high-and-mighty. Throughout the album he
takes aim at these negative tropes in music:

> Paradise in a gold watch
>
> I was right, the price was a lot
>
> Mildly disappointed that all those guns was props.

and

> I don't wanna go see Nas with an orchestra at Carnegie Hall
>
> No man of the people, I wouldn't be caught dead with most of y'all
>
> "Don't call me again" what I shoula said when he called

_Hiding Places_ is just the right combination of angry, hateful, despondent, and
miserable. At 40 minutes long it is incredibly succinct for how deeply
it explores these feelings. I find it to be one of the most creatively
honest albums with no radio tracks or meaningless features. If it doesn't
contribute to the experience, then it isn't featured.

## Bandana

### Freddie Gibbs & Madlib
