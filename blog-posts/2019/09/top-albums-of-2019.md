### DNA

![XXX](/images/albums/top-verses/xxx.jpg)

>Warhols all on the wall of the villa
 Adderall popping got me jumping to ceiling
 Perceived as a villian no sentiment in my sentence
 For instance in instants they'll be calling forensics
 If incidents occur remember these ain't just words
 Go from talking shit to organs preserved
 You soft serve rappers just hide behind your reverb
 And even without effects you'll end up dessert
 I research and homework, make you dig ya own dirt
 On beats buried alive, ratting wiseguys
 I'm with a latin bitch, fat ass, well porportioned thighs
 And love to see it cumming so I squirt it in her eyes
 I'm hopping out that new shit like narcs on Tuesday
 The grill on it shiny like LL Cool J's
 What's on my waist could make a nigga meet ya doomsday
 To describe ya mixtape that shit was like a toothache

### You Ain't a Killer

![XXX](/images/albums/top-verses/xxx.jpg)

>It's hard to analyze which guys are spies; be advised, people
 We recognize who lies, it's all in the eyes, chico
 We read 'em and see 'em for what they are
 D's in undercover cars
 Takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
 I'm up to par, my game is in a smash
 With half a million in the stash
 Passport with the gats, first name and last
 Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
 Give me the mini-shottie
 I'll body a nigga for a penny probably
 I'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
 If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
 I hate the fact that I'm the last edition
 Properly a stats magician
 Could've went to college and been a mathematician
 Bad decisions kept me out the game
 Now I'm strictly out for cream
 Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
 My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
 Measured by the Heaven's kings
 Down to the Devil's mezzanine
 I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
 Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
 So be advised: the street's full of surprises
 It's not what crew's the livest
 One that survive, it's who's the wisest

### Life's a Btch

>Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
 Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
 And my mentality is money-orientated
 I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
 ‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
 But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
 Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
 Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
 Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
 'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
 Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
 But as long as we leavin' thievin'
 We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
 So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
 Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
 Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
 ‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

### Beef Rap

>What up?
 To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
 And keep your shirt on, at least a button-up
 Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
 Out of work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
 They chippin' nails, DOOM, tippin' scales
 Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
 This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
 Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
 Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
 After which they couldn't find the Villain like Scooby
 He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
 Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
 Punk, try and ask why ours be better
 Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
 Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude 

# DOOM

## America's Most Blunted

>Quas, when he really hit star mode
 Never will he boost loose Phillies with the bar-code
 Or take a whole carload on a wasted trip
 Or sit White Owl laced tip from tip with yip
 Some rather baggies others like their cracks in vials
 Catch a tag, roll a bag of schwag in a Black & Mild
 He twist Optimo, just the raw leaf part
 The list top go: bust before beef start
 At the Stop-n-Go Mart, actin like a spirit host done it
 "America's most blunted!"
 Yeah, yo
 DOOM nominated for the best rolled L's
 And they wondered how he dealt with stress so well
 Wild guess? You could say he stay sedated
 Some say buddha-ed, some say faded
 Someday pray that he will grow a farm barn full
 Recent research show it's not so darn harmful (true)
 Sometimes you might need to detox
 It can help you with your rhyme flow and your beat-box
 Off spite to your surprise
 Turn a Newport Light to a joint right before your eyes
 Tear a page out the good book, hear it how you want it

### Living In The World Today

>My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
 Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
 Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
 Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
 Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that
 Bind-in, X marks the spot on the scope
 Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
 MCs bet they best at every
 Powerful parable ditties might harm
 If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
 Flashbacks to the "Duel of the Iron Mic"
 Look out for these fatal flying spikes, of massive
 Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
 Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
 Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
 My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous
