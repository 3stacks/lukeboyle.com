"On a scale of one to ten, how bad would you say your pain is?" asks a doctor.

"Oh, definitely a nine" replies the patient.

If that was truly a 9/10 on the most excrutiating pain do you think the patient would be able to reply?
I was speaking to a paramedic and she said that patients almost always inflate their pain scores.

So what's an easier way to conceptualise the scale? How about, on a scale of one to ten, one being a papercut, ten being childbirth.

It always helps to ground abstract numbers with real experiences or emotions.
