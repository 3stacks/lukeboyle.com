I do a lot of complaining about privacy and annoying products, but there
are some that I believe really do a good job. These are some companies
whose products and missions are appealing enough I'd want to work there.

## YNAB (You Need A Budget)

YNAB is a very interesting take on budgeting. I used to swear by my old
way of using a spreadsheet, but it sort of falls apart when your pay
is irregular (like for self-employed people or freelancers with variable
income). You can connect your bank accounts for automatic transaction
feeds but I prefer doing it manually as it seems to make you more mindful
about your spending.

### Reporting

I'm a real metric head, so I appreciate some good graphs.

#### Age of money

Age of money tells you how long between getting paid do you spend your
money. It's very encouraging to see yourself breaking the cycle of
pay-cheque to pay-cheque.

#### Net worth

Net worth is pretty self explanatory. It tracks your assets versus your
debts and gives you a nice net worth graph over time.

#### Spending

You also get a categorical breakdown of your spending which you can

### Free budgeting resources

The bulk of their blog posts are not YNAB specific, but include general
advice for budgeting, so if you're struggling, it may be helpful for you.

If that sounds appealing, there's a link below which includes a referral
(if you sign up I get a free month. If you aren't cool with that,
just search for YNAB). They offer a month long free trial if you feel
like giving it a shot.

## Cloudflare

According to their website, Cloudflare now powers nearly 10 percent of
all Internet requests. I've been using them for a few years now and
I'm still in awe of them. First of all, when I started using them I was
still paying for SSL certificates, then here comes this start-up that
offers DDoS protection, SSL and caching and it's free... Where's the
catch? I do find it somewhat suspicious that they're able to offer these
services for free. Presumably the money they make off enterprise
accounts offsets the usage at the free tier.

The DNS settings are really easy to use too. I use the analytics on this
site and it seems to block a few threats a week.

They are now offering domain registrations which I haven't taken advantage
of, but they seem to be cheaper than your run of the mill registrar.

They also do a lot of very interesting technical writing. Curious why
their office has a wall covered in lava lamps?

## 1Password

Password managers are certainly rising in popularity and it's a good thing.
The password is a very flawed authentication method especially when you
re-use the same weak password across multiple sites. If you can instead
remember one very strong password, you'll be able to generate strong,
unique passwords for every service you use. They also now have built in
support for the Google Authenticator protocol with TOTP tokens.

I really like the mobile and desktop apps and they have recently
released a browser only client. Along with their provided cloud sync
options, they also offer personal cloud storage syncing.

You can also enable travel mode for when you're overseas which stops
syncing sensitive vaults.

I use the shared vaults a lot to share with coworkers.

I'm planning on keeping this list updated should anything change, so
keep your eyes on this post.
