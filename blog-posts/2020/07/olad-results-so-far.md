3 months ago I started a [new OLAD program](/blog-posts/2020/04/experimenting-with-olad). So far it has been a massive
success. My lifts are up considerably, and I'm just generally enjoying my time in the gym.

## Before

<dl>
    <dt>Back Squat</dt> 
    <dd>95kg x 3</dd>
    <dt>Overhead press</dt> 
    <dd>67.5kg x 1</dd>
    <dt>Farmer Carry</dt> 
    <dd>140kg (15 meters) x 2)</dd>
    <dt>Bench Press</dt> 
    <dd>80kg x 5</dd>
    <dt>Deadlift / Deficit Deadlift</dt> 
    <dd>125kg x 5</dd>
    <dt>Pendlay Row</dt> 
    <dd>70kg x 5</dd>
    <dt>Pull up</dt>
    <dd>BW(115.7kg)x3</dd>
    <dt>Trap bar deadlift</dt>
    <dd>145kg x 1</dd>
</dl>

## After

<dl>
    <dt>Back Squat</dt> 
    <dd>115kg x 2 +16.35% 1RM</dd>
    <dt>Overhead press</dt> 
    <dd>80kg x 2 +24.4% 1RM</dd>
    <dt>Farmer Carry</dt> 
    <dd>168kg for 15 meters x 2 - +20.4% 1RM</dd>
    <dt>Bench Press</dt> 
    <dd>110kg x 1 - +18.3%</dd>
    <dt>Deadlift / Deficit Deadlift</dt> 
    <dd>165kg x 2 - +18.5%</dd>
    <dt>Pendlay Row</dt> 
    <dd>85kg x 4 - +17.1%</dd>
    <dt>Pull up</dt>
    <dd>BW(122kg)x2</dd>
    <dt>Trap bar deadlift</dt>
    <dd>180kg x 3 - +35.2%</dd>
</dl>

So how did I "increase my 1RM by 18-35%"? One simple trick! "Adherence" (and maybe a bit of residual newbie gains).

I really just owe this adherence to the renewed enjoyment I've had in the gym. It's pretty great to get out of the gym
within 45 minutes (excluding prehab/rehab). I was quite fatigued by the few cycles of 5/3/1 I had just done (not to
mention the 1.5 hour workouts), so it made sense I was burned out.

All things considered, I'm really happy with this program. After my second knee dislocation in 2019 I didn't expect to
be squatting again but here we are. It's not the most encouraging sign when your bench is beating your squat, but I'm not giving up.

### Squat

I have no recent squat footage so here's some of this weird reverse safety bar front squat thing I got from [John Meadows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUAOLEPEuV0)
