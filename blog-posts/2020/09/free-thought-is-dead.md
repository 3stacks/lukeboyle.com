**The Beltway Bubble** is a phenomenon (that is not new, by any means, but has previously
existed only in theory [1](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/40/2/103/4210575))
where journalists in Washington (known as The Beltway) subscribe solely to journalists whose
opinions they are more likely to agree with. As a journalist, it seems self-evident that
you would benefit from exposure to differing opinions, as it gives you a sounding board for
demographics. People are predictable creatures, and they tend to prefer news that confirms
their opinions (see Confirmation Bias [ref]). It stands to reason, that when an organisation
reports on content that resonates with more people, there's a positive feedback loop (that is,
assuming more website traffic = more money) which prompts them to report more on that topic
or with that political bent.

The effect of the Beltway Bubble is most evident in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential
election. As at the election in November, Real Clear Politics aggregate polling gave Donald
Trump a polling lead in 29 out of 261 polls (~11% ) [2](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html).
That roughly translates to the odds that were being forecast, giving Hillary Clinton a
roughly 90% chance of winning the election. Many of the poll results were close, however, CNN
stood out giving Clinton a 24 point lead over Trump.

So, imagine you're a journalist at CNN and all the rhetoric you hear at work strongly favours
Clinton, your polling strongly favours Clinton, your contemporaries at other outlets
(within the bubble, of course) strongly favour Clinton. When the results came in post-election
(electoral college controversy aside), --- describe the shock, how the results have largely still not been accepted. russian bots etc ---

## Fact checkers

In the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, the internet was whipped into a fury with
claims about whether or not he deserved it. One of the claims was that Blake had prior charges of third degree sexual
assault, apparently some people have used to conclude that he sexually assaulted a minor which which, by all accounts,
appears to be incorrect. Anecdotally, I saw this rumour online once. However you feel about this, sexual assault is not
punishable with the death penalty, or with permanent paralysis for that matter, so the claim that he deserved to be
shot for this is obviously absurd.

If you view this claim on Snopes ([https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jacob-blake-sexual-assault-charge/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jacob-blake-sexual-assault-charge/))

The URL is important. The slug says "sexual assault charge", but if you view the claim it says "raping a child". These are very
different statements.

In the claim below:

![Snopes fact check about Jacob Blake raping a child. It is marked as False](/web/public/images/free-thought/snopes-jacob-blake.png)

Snopes is 100% correct here. If the claim is "Jacob Blake raped a child", that is verifiably false. However, details of
the sexual assault charge don't appear until 300 words into the analysis, far below the fold. Snopes says "Some online
commentators and social media users sought to justify Blakeâ€™s shooting and/or undermine the legitimacy of protests
surrounding it." They never provide any evidence that these claims have been made, but expect us to faithfully accept it.
If the claim was about the sexual assault charge (as the URL indicates) then the rating would have been "Mostly true"
or "Partly true". It could be argued that Snopes purposely picked the most extreme claims in order to alter their rating
of the claim's veracity. An acceptable counterpoint here might be that Snopes must indeed take the most extreme claims
so they are able to cover the whole gamut of potentially false claims, however, in some other cases it seems that the
claims are being misrepresented in order to obfuscate the truth. (TODO: find more examples)

Let's take the claim "The URL antifa.com automatically redirects to the official campaign website of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden."
You can verify this one for yourself as of the 2nd of September. Visit antifa.com and you will be redirected to Joe Biden's
website. That is objectively true. So what does Snopes say? "Mostly true".

![](/web/public/images/free-thought/snopes-antifa-biden.jpg)

They clarify in the **What's false** section, "However, there are no apparent links between any of the website redirects and the Joe Biden campaign".
That wasn't even in the claim they were fact checking. From the outside, it looks as though they added additional context so that the rating
would not simply be "True".

## The echochamber

## notes

-   A topic doesn't become valid until it's reported on by news organisations
-   Wikipedia pages are mostly based on reporting by news organisations, so if a topic is not reported on in the news,
    it won't be covered at all.
-   So if a topic is considered taboo, and there are no articles being written about it then where do you get the information from?

## Have white supremacists infiltrated police forces?

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/27/white-supremacists-militias-infiltrate-us-police-report
https://truthout.org/articles/white-supremacist-groups-have-infiltrated-us-police-departments-report-says/

The Guardian, et al. have referenced this Brennan Centre think tank article about white supremacists infiltrating
police. You don't need to think too hard to realise that there's truth to this. At a time there were an estimated \_\_\_\_ KKK members
in police forces across America.

But when you go to the report The Guardian is referencing https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/hidden-plain-sight-racism-white-supremacy-and-far-right-militancy-law
