I realise that this is one of the most well-explored topics on the
privacy-conscious edges of the internet, but seriously... Do not trust Google.
Facebook seems to be our current punching bag of choice because of their supposed
ability to manipulate political opinion, but in my opinion Google is a much more insidious company
with far greater potential for abuse. Google is the [largest advertising platform](https://www.investopedia.com/news/facebook-google-digital-ad-market-share-drops-amazon-climbs/)
by a significant margin (accounting for 36.3% of advertising in the U.S. with Facebook trailing at 19.3%). At the
end of the day, if you delete your Facebook account, what are you really missing out on? Photos of friends and family
members, easy access to chat, and heavily biased news (CITATION NEEDED).

Google (or more specifically Alphabet Inc.) owns the largest search engine (Google.com), the largest video streaming platform (Youtube),
and the most-used smartphone operating system (Android)

You might ask, "What's wrong with that? Sounds like they're just very successful at what they do". Well, let's break
down those three markets (Search, Streaming, Mobile).

![The classic Google slogan "Don't be evil", except the end of the "don't" is crossed out so it says "Do be evil"](/blog-posts/images/do-not-trust-google/do-be-evil.jpg)

## Search

Google's estimated market share for search traffic globally is 92.16% [source](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share).
As people increasingly are using search to navigate the web (as opposed to typing a URL into the address bar), this
traffic increases, those people see more ads, Google makes more money. Google then uses this money to purchase exclusivity
agreements with the likes of Apple (just two years ago it was announce that Google would be paying \$12 billion US to Apple to remain
the default search engine on Safari in 2019 [source](https://fortune.com/2018/09/29/google-apple-safari-search-engine/) at a cost of roughly
\$10 per user).

### How does Google abuse Search?

If you ask the average user how Google search works, they'd probably say "it just searches for your search term across the web", but what
they probably don't know is that is just the tip of the iceberg. Other dimensions of search include:

-   what kind of users go to that websites (and does the user searching fit that profile)?
-   how much traffic does the website get?
-   how relevant the content is to the search term (SEO magic)?
-   and, most importantly, does this website fit an acceptable narrative?

There's certainly an argument to be made for suppressing some search results (such as pro-authoritarian sites
(e.g. communist or fascist), extremely fringe conspiracy, illegal pornography, or bomb-making instructions) because
advertisers probably don't want their ads next to those results. Rightly or wrongly, Google is already suppressing
content from such websites (though, they're probably still indexing them).

If Google can suppress fascist content from sites like Stormfront (prominent white-supremacy forum), then who is to
say which content they can or cannot suppress? Breitbart is a well-known right wing news site that has had their
content [almost entirely purged](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2020/07/28/election-interference-google-purges-breitbart-from-search-results/)
from Google search results (as evidenced by the "search engine visibility" chart below).

![Search engine visibility index for Breitbart.com shows significant increase in visibility leading up to the 2016 presidential election with a sharp drop in mid 2017](/blog-posts/images/do-not-trust-google/breitbart-visibility-index.jpg)

You don't have to agree with them politically to see that Google is applying different standards to conservative content
than to more liberal content. I don't visit Breitbart, I don't read their articles, and frankly I don't give a shit
what they have to say, but I believe in a free and open internet. If you believe in a free and open internet then you have to agree this is wrong. During the cold
war, anyone who didn't follow the extreme protectionist beliefs (CITATION NEEDED) of the time were shouted down as
communists. This same thing is happening now, but the buzz word is different. The new weaponised word is "racist". If
time had elapsed differently, I have no doubt that it would be left-wing websites suppressed in search results, and that still wouldn't be okay.

There's plenty of evidence to suggest that Google is manually making these decisions to block conservative websites,
however, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai denied that they manually censor websites at the recent [Congressional antitrust hearing](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/29/tech-hearings-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-amazon-jeff-bezos-apple-tim-cook-google-sundar-pichai-congress)
except for in cases where there are legal requirements or copyright issues. I don't buy that, personally.

## Streaming

When Youtube was founded it was facing severe scaling problems (because video processing and streaming is extremly expensive).
Fortunately for them, Google saw potential in the platform and purchased the company for \$1.65bn in Google stock, and their money
issues were over. Google was throwing money into scaling the platform, and it was experiencing great growth. This success turned
out to be a major problem for the Youtube, because, from the time it was purchased it has been making a loss. In recent years,
Youtube has become profitable, however, without the bottomless pockets of Google behind it, they never would have been
able to accomplish this. What incentive could Google have to take losses year after year on Youtube? Well, it turns
out user data is particularly delicious. Mastercard's CEO has infamously said ["data is the new oil"](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/24/mastercard-boss-just-said-data-is-the-new-oil.html).
I personally can't wait for Facebook, Amazon, and Google to become para-military organisations in the up-coming data wars.

Youtube has essentially bullied their way into market dominance using Google's bottomless pit of money. This is problematic
because it allows failing companies to cheat death. Just like a bottom-feeding fish,latching onto a whale shark and hitching a ride.
As I mentioned before, video streaming is extremely expensive, so it makes sense that great cloud infrastructure is a prerequisite to
success. Well, big surprise, Google offers world-class commercial cloud infrastructure with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)!
Do you suppose Youtube is paying full price for their infra?

So, when you see a headline that says "[Stop paying for iCloud â€“ Google One will now back up your iPhone for free](https://bgr.com/2020/07/30/google-one-free-phone-backup-ios-android/)".
Before obeying the shill who wrote it, you should ask yourself, "How can a company afford to give away so much storage space for free?". Well, they can't.
Google simply obscures their losses with the immense revenue from Google Ads in the profit/loss statement at the end of each quarter.
For more reading about this topic, Tim Bray has a fantastic article called ["Break up Google"](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google).

## Mobile

This article is already becoming too long, so I'm just going to cover mobile quickly. As Tim Bray mentions in the
article above, Android isn't really a business. The only real non-ad revenue they have is from the commission they get
from app purchases and licensing fees from OEMs (e.g. Samsung, Huawei, LG). How, then, are they able to sustain
hundreds of highly paid engineers and all the other non-technical staff required to support the system?

![A map of the world with Android vs iOS market share. iOS is most dominant in first-world countries, whereas Android dominates emerging nations](/blog-posts/images/do-not-trust-google/android-ios-market-share.jpg)

Above is a map of Android vs iOS market shares. You can see that iOS pretty much only has the dominant market share
in first world countries (like USA, Canada, Australia, UK, Japan). Most of the emerging countries in the world are
strongly in favour of Android because, unlike Apple, the OS is not restricted to a particular device. So, countries like
India (where the number of smart-phone users has increased sharply from 199 million in 2015 to 401 million in 2020 [source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/))
that mostly purchase low-cost phones (e.g. Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo). Emerging markets are extremely important to companies
like Google partly because these countries are easier to exploit because they don't have strong legislation to protect
users from predatory advertising, anticompetitive tactics, or data privacy. This is why I speculate that Mastercard is
scrambling to [connect refugees to the global payment network](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2020/05/06/financial-inclusion-helps-refugees-move-from-aid-recipients-to-earners-and-tax-payers) (Remember that quote from the Mastercard CEO: "Data is the new oil")
and, indeed, why Mastercard [forced Patreon to ban Robert Spencer for his anti-refugee sentiment](https://www.jihadwatch.org/2018/08/patreon-and-mastercard-ban-robert-spencer-without-explanation).

Again, regardless of whether you agree with someone's political leaning or rhetoric, I shouldn't have to explain
why it's ludicrous for people to believe that faceless, soulless corporations such as MasterCard or Google give
two fucks about moral righteousness when their only servant is a number ticker on the Nasdaq website.

## Closing thoughts

All of that is to say
