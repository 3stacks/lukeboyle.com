One of the unfortunate realities of life is that people die. The music industry,
eager to exploit, will often take this opportunity to cash in. They'll
bastardise the hard work of productive musicians and release
posthumous albums, and countless remixes of classic songs with various artists.
Look no further than the discography of Notorious B.I.G, 2pac, Big L, or more recently, XXXTentacion.

The announcement of _Circles_ was something different. Mac was working diligently
to finish this album before his untimely death in 2018. A significant portion Swimming
and Circles was "executive produced" by Jon Brion. When I initially saw his writing
credits on Swimming I was quite surprised. "The guy who did Magnolia?"

If you consider his work in film, Jon really does a masterful job of
conveying [tone](https://youtu.be/OftqMORxGCE?list=TLPQMjEwMTIwMjAAvHm6l06TAg&t=96). How you
connect the dots between a composer who is most well known for his work on movie scores and a trendy
rap artist is a mystery to me. I have to thank Jon for the inspiration/encouragement he gave Malcolm.
Though, in his interview with Zane Lowe, he insists "That's not something I created, that's something
he was doing and I was only asking him to recognise that it was already great".

Between Swimming and Circles, there are plentiful references to death and leaving this world.
Some may take this as a prediction, but I think that could be considered confirmation bias. Plenty
of rappers write about suicide but they're still here. And I don't believe he truly wanted to die.
As he says in Complicated, "Fore I start to think about the future. First, can I please get through a day?"

The painful part of listening to this album is the feeling of finality.
There will never again be a Mac Miller album that was wholly - or even
partially - designed by him.
The circle is often seen as a symbol of permanence and immortality, like
the Ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail) in Greek mythology. So, it's only
fitting that the album to solidify his legacy in our minds is Circles.

Circles feels like a realisation that life isn't a comedy but it's more
of a tragedy with comic relief. True maturity is welcoming that reality
but recognising that sometimes the best you can do is keep Swimming in Circles.
