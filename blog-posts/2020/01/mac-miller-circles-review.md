One of the unfortunate realities of life is that people die. The music industry,
eager to exploit, will often take this opportunity to cash in. They'll
bastardise the hard work of productive musicians and release
posthumous albums, and countless remixes of classic songs with various artists.
Look no further than the discography of Notorious B.I.G, 2pac, Big L, or more recently, XXXTentacion.

The announcement of _Circles_ was something different. Mac was working diligently
to finish this album before his untimely death in 2018. A significant portion of _Swimming_
 and _Circles_ was "executive produced" by Jon Brion who carried the torch and tried to finish
the album as Mac intended it. When I initially saw his writing credits on Swimming I 
was quite surprised. 

I pondered the mystery of how you connect the dots between an eccentric composer who is most 
well known for his work on movie scores and a trendy rap artist. Turns out, it's not that
much of a mystery at all. In an [episode of _What's In My Bag_ with Amoeba records](https://youtu.be/qnhbHFgagIM)
, Jon Brion says: "You know, my complaint about most people who make records and go out and 
shove their shit down people's throats is that... all I see them doing is giving me their 
impression of what they think they're supposed to be doing. And it's what bores me about 
99.999% of people who make stuff". For a man who said that to clear his calendar and 
help finish Swimming and Circles, he must have really been excited about working with
Mac.    

If you consider his work in film, Jon really does a masterful job of
conveying [tone](https://youtu.be/OftqMORxGCE?list=TLPQMjEwMTIwMjAAvHm6l06TAg&t=96). 
I have to thank Jon for the inspiration/encouragement he gave Mac, but in his 
[ interview with Zane Lowe](https://youtu.be/faEKDnNXt4o), he insists 
"That's not something I created, that's something he was doing and I was only 
asking him to recognise that it was already great".

The album is littered with references to time. More specifically it seems to be about how you perceive time.
Do you let time be a tyrant in your life and fight it, or do you go with the flow and ride it out?
One of the greatest albums of all time is Dark Side of the Moon which also featured references to time 
very prominently. Dark Side of the Moon starts and ends the same way, with a heartbeat. This seems to
represent the cycle of life: a notion that is paralleled in the opening track _Circles_. The line goes
"I just end up right at the start of the line. Drawin' circles". Similarly, every day ends 
the same way it begins; the hands of the clock go around in a circle until they strike 12. 

It seems like Mac was living in the present which is a comforting way to approach life when you're going 
through a hard time. Lyrics like "I've got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling" 
and "'fore I start to think about the future. First, can I please get through a day?". He's taking life 
one day at a time and working through the "clutter" in his head.

Woods is my favourite track on the album. It's probably the most subdued track with very sparse lyrics and 
instrumentation. The opening lines of "Things like this ain't built to last, I might just fade like those
before me". This could be interpreted a few ways. This album was recorded shortly after the loss of his 
 relationship. It feels like saying "If you were able to forget the people you used to love and love
 me, then surely you'll be able to forget me and move on". Another interpretation could be his anxiety 
 about his legacy and whether he did enough to be remembered. 
 
Hands takes the metaphor of time further. The beat sounds reminiscent of a clock ticking, and hands 
seems to refer to the hands of a clock. It seems to be a letter to himself urging him to ease up
on himself and stop feeling so low. "When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?" 
and later in the chorus "No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed". "Never half-speed" 
might suggest that he is always speeding and might benefit from slowing down. This hearkens back to 
the line on Small Worlds (_Swimming_): "I'm always in a rush, I been thinking too much"

Strangely, it feels as though any track on the album could have been the last track and it wouldn't
be lacking. But what's important is that the final track represents the last goodbye. The important
thing to nail is the tone. Jon Brion made the decision to put _Once A Day_ at the end, and it 
was a very intentional decision. What message did he want to leave us with for the final act of Mac?
Once a day opens with a monologue "Once a day, I rise. Once a day, I fall asleep with you". He's 
really talking to himself. You spend more time with yourself than anyone else and it's important 
for you to be comfortable with that. "Don't keep it all in your head. The only place that you know nobody
can ever see". _Once A Day_ is a tale of inner peace and a final reminder that we need to stay 
open, not just to others, but most importantly, to ourselves. 

The painful part of listening to this album is the feeling of finality.
There will never again be a Mac Miller album that was wholly - or even
partially - designed by him.
The circle is often seen as a symbol of permanence and immortality, like
the Ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail) in Greek mythology. So, it's only
fitting that the album to solidify his legacy in our minds is Circles.

Circles feels like a realisation that life isn't a comedy but it's more
of a tragedy with comic relief. True maturity is welcoming that reality
but recognising that sometimes the best you can do is keep Swimming in Circles.
