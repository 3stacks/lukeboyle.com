One of the unfortunate realities of life is that people die. The music industry,
eager to exploit, will often take this opportunity to cash in. They'll
bastardise the hard work of productive musicians and release
posthumous albums, and countless remixes of classic songs with various artists.
Look no further than the discography of Notorious B.I.G, 2pac, Big L, or more recently, XXXTentacion.

The announcement of _Circles_ was something different. Mac was working diligently
to finish this album before his untimely death in 2018. A significant portion _Swimming_
and _Circles_ was "executive produced" by Jon Brion who carried the torch and tried to finish
the album as Mac intended it. When I initially saw his writing credits on Swimming I 
was quite surprised. "The guy who did Magnolia?" 

If you consider his work in film, Jon really does a masterful job of
conveying [tone](https://youtu.be/OftqMORxGCE?list=TLPQMjEwMTIwMjAAvHm6l06TAg&t=96). How you
connect the dots between a composer who is most well known for his work on movie scores and a trendy
rap artist is a mystery to me. I have to thank Jon for the inspiration/encouragement he gave Malcolm.
Though, in his interview with Zane Lowe, he insists "That's not something I created, that's something
he was doing and I was only asking him to recognise that it was already great".

The album is littered with references to time. More specifically it seems to be about how you perceive time.
Do you let time be a tyrant in your life and fight it, or do you go with the flow and ride it out?
One of the great albums of all time is Dark Side of the Moon which also featured references to time 
very prominently. Dark Side of the Moon starts and ends the same way, with a heartbeat. This seems to
represent the cycle of life: a notion that is paralleled in the opening track _Circles_. The line goes
"I just end up right at the start of the line. Drawin' circles" 

It seems like Malcolm was living in the present which is a comforting way to approach life when you're going 
through a hard time. Lyrics like "I've got all the time in the world, so for now I'm just chilling" 
and "'fore I start to think about the future. First, can I please get through a day?". He's taking life 
one day at a time and working on the "clutter" in his head.

Blue World
Good News
I can see
Everybody

Woods is my favourite track on the album. It's probably the most subdued track with very sparse lyrics and 
instrumentation. The opening lines of "Things like this ain't built to last, I might just fade like those
before me". This could be interpreted a few ways. This album was recorded shortly after the loss of his 
 relationship. It feels like saying "If you were able to forget the people you used to love and love
 me, then surely you'll be able to forget me and move on". Another interpretation could be his anxiety 
 about his legacy and whether he did enough to be remembered. 
 
Hand me downs

That's on me

Hands takes the metaphor of time further. The beat sounds reminiscent of a clock ticking, and hands 
seems to refer to the hands of a clock. It seems to be a letter to himself really te
 "When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?"

Surf
Once a day

Between Swimming and Circles, there are plentiful references to death and leaving this world.
Some may take this as a prediction, but I think that could be considered confirmation bias. Plenty
of rappers write about suicide but they're still here. And I don't believe he truly wanted to die.
As he says in Complicated, "Fore I start to think about the future. First, can I please get through a day?"

The painful part of listening to this album is the feeling of finality.
There will never again be a Mac Miller album that was wholly - or even
partially - designed by him.
The circle is often seen as a symbol of permanence and immortality, like
the Ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail) in Greek mythology. So, it's only
fitting that the album to solidify his legacy in our minds is Circles.

Circles feels like a realisation that life isn't a comedy but it's more
of a tragedy with comic relief. True maturity is welcoming that reality
but recognising that sometimes the best you can do is keep Swimming in Circles.
