One of the unfortunate realities of life is that people die. The music industry,
eager to exploit, will often take this opportunity to cash in. They'll
bastardise the hard work of productive musicians and release
posthumous albums, and countless remixes of classic songs with various artists.
Look no further than the discography of Notorious B.I.G, 2pac, Big L, or more recently, XXXTENTACION.

The announcement of _Circles_ was something different. Mac was working diligently
to finish this album before his untimely death in 2018. A significant portion of _Swimming_
 and _Circles_ was "executive produced" by Jon Brion who carried the torch and tried to finish
the album as Mac intended it. When I initially saw his writing credits on Swimming I 
was quite surprised. 

I pondered the mystery of how you connect the dots between an eccentric composer who is most 
well known for his work on movie scores and a trendy rap artist. Turns out, it's not that
much of a mystery at all. In an [episode of _What's In My Bag_ with Amoeba records](https://youtu.be/qnhbHFgagIM)
, Jon Brion says "You know, my complaint about most people who make records and go out and 
shove their shit down people's throats is that... all I see them doing is giving me their 
impression of what they think they're supposed to be doing. And it's what bores me about 
99.999% of people who make stuff." For a man who said that to clear his calendar and 
help finish Circles, he must have really been excited about working with Mac.

If you consider his work in film, Jon really does a masterful job of
conveying [tone](https://youtu.be/OftqMORxGCE?list=TLPQMjEwMTIwMjAAvHm6l06TAg&t=96). 
I have to thank Jon for the inspiration/encouragement he gave Mac, but in 
his [interview with Zane Lowe](https://youtu.be/faEKDnNXt4o), he insists 
"That's not something I created, that's something he was doing and I was only 
asking him to recognise that it was already great."

The album is littered with references to time. More specifically it seems to be about how you perceive time.
Do you let time be a tyrant in your life and fight it, or do you go with the flow and ride it out?
One of the greatest albums of all time is _Dark Side of the Moon_ which also featured references to time 
very prominently. _Dark Side of the Moon_ starts and ends the same way, with a heartbeat. This seems to
represent the cycle of life: a notion that is paralleled in the opening track _Circles_. The line goes
"I just end up right at the start of the line. Drawin' circles." Similarly, every day ends 
the same way it begins; the hands of the clock go around in a circle until they strike 12.

After the very sombre start, the synth and funky bassline of Complicated was fairly jarring on first listen. After
going back through for a second time, it really just seemed to make sense. The lyrics are very dour which contrasts 
beautifully with the rather upbeat and playful instrumental. Many songs use this tactic like a trojan horse to insert
some meaning into poppy songs, because they probably wouldn't top the Billboard 200 if the instrumentals matched the 
lyrics. (See [_Hey Ya_ by Outkast](https://youtu.be/6DyPtvxln2c)). A recent example is in the Purple Mountains 
song _All My Happiness Is Gone_. The late David Berman said in [an interview](http://exclaim.ca/music/article/david_berman_discusses_every_song_on_purple_mountains_self-titled_new_album) 
"it just complexifies the profile of it to have the music and the words at odds". As it turns out, Complicated wasn't 
originally made for the album<sub>[1]</sub>, but it fits beautifully. Leading on from _Come Back to Earth_ on Swimming 
where he says "I just need a way out of my head", _Complicated_ has the first reference to his difficulties unravelling 
the mess in his head which ties into _Good News_ later in the album.

With Circles and Complicated, I get the impression that Mac was living in the present which is a comforting way to 
approach life when you're going through a hard time. Lyrics like "I've got all the time in the world, so for now 
I'm just chilling" and "'fore I start to think about the future. First, can I please get through a day?". 
He's taking life one day at a time and working through the "clutter" in his head. The downside of this approach is you 
can easily forget about the bigger picture and end up clinging to destructive coping mechanisms.

Aside from a few leaks like "Telescope" (which became Woods) and Once a Day (which was played during his _A 
Celebration of Life_ as a straight piano ballad), Good News was the only music released to promote the album 
(perfect choice). Mac opens the track talking about fighting his demons 
("I spent the whole day in my head, Do a little spring cleanin'"), but often feeling hamstrung by his own instincts to 
self-sabotage. He says, "I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way", and "Why I gotta build something beautiful
just to go and set it on fire?"

With a different interpretation, these lyrics could have been delivered with a very moody inflection to create a much 
darker tone, but the muted string plucking and sparse instrumentation give this very calming, ethereal feeling. 
This track also features guitar from Wendy Melvoin (guitarist for Prince's band, The Revolution), when you consider 
that John Mayer played guitar on _Small Worlds_, it's really clear how infectious Mac Miller's talent was. 
These great musicians happily collaborated with him with very little public recognition. Paired with the subdued 
vocals it is just a beautiful tribute to his life and legacy and a reassuring reminder from the great beyond. 

Especially when coupled with the [music video](https://youtu.be/aIHF7u9Wwiw), it has a surreal quality that feels 
like he's in the room talking to you. It almost sounds like he's reassuring people from the great beyond with lyrics
like "There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side". It's a story of the immortal quality of 
music. So, it only makes sense that an image of Mac appears in a Lotus flower which has a symbolic meaning in Buddhism.
It resembles the purifying of the spirit which is born into murkiness<sub>[2]</sub>. The ending of him walking through
the airplane window and disappearing as a ripple in the water is superb and continues to drive home the aquatic theme.
Good News is the best send-off anyone could hope for.

Woods is my favourite track on the album. It's probably the most subdued track with very sparse lyrics and 
instrumentation. The opening lines of "Things like this ain't built to last, I might just fade like those
before me" could be interpreted a few ways. This album was recorded shortly after the loss of a 
 relationship. It feels like saying "If you were able to forget the people you used to love and love
 me, then surely you'll be able to forget me and move on". Another interpretation could be his anxiety 
 about his legacy and whether he did enough to be remembered. 
  
Hand Me Downs is a testament to Mac's commitment on his last two albums. In my opinion the best albums seldom have 
artists featured. To me, it exudes a lack of confidence in what you're producing and a level of insecurity that you 
feel as though you need to attach bigger names to your songs for them to be well liked. The feature on this album by 
Baro Sura was a very purposeful choice and it only seems to serve the album's narrative and vibe. And with Baro 
being a relatively unknown artist it feels like this was someone Mac really liked and believed in, and he delivered 
a great performance.

The line "I move carelessly that's why I'm always tripping" is a great double entendre. Beyond the literal meaning, 
the line says that he's moving through life without caring about the consequences, which is why he engages in such 
destructive behaviours. And lines like "And half the time the wheels that's in the back of my mind Just keep on turning 
'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack" echo the message that he feels trapped in his mind with all of the 
clutter and dealing with his problems is an exhausting process

asdfasdfdsazf
 
that's on me
 
Hands takes the metaphor of time further. The beat sounds reminiscent of a clock ticking, and hands 
seems to refer to the hands of a clock. It seems to be a letter to himself urging him to ease up
on himself and stop feeling so low. "When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?" 
and later in the chorus "No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed". "Never half-speed" 
might suggest that he is always speeding and might benefit from slowing down. This hearkens back to 
the line on Small Worlds (_Swimming_): "I'm always in a rush, I been thinking too much".

He also seems to be lamenting the way he behaves in relationships. Mac knows he's a bit of a fuck-up. On Good News he 
says "And all I do is say sorry. Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about"

"You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death"

"Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next"

On Surf, Mac seems to be reconciling his desire to be loved with his emotional 
volatility. On Hands he said "Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi. 
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy". He's simultaneously pushing 
people away and lamenting his loneliness. Surf is a more tender approach. "Where 
are you going? Can I come too?" 

"Until we get old. There's water in the flowers, let's grow" - Embracing the 
pursuit of personal improvement? 

"Get Going going going before I'm gone"

Strangely, it feels as though any track on the album could have been the last track and it wouldn't
be lacking. But what's important is that the final track represents the last goodbye. The important
thing to nail is the tone. Jon Brion made the decision to put _Once A Day_ at the end, and it 
was a very intentional decision. What message did he want to leave us with for the final act of Mac?
Once a day opens with a monologue "Once a day, I rise. Once a day, I fall asleep with you". He's 
really talking to himself. You spend more time with yourself than anyone else and it's important 
for you to be comfortable with that. "Don't keep it all in your head. The only place that you know nobody
can ever see". _Once A Day_ is a tale of inner peace and a final reminder that we need to stay 
open, not just to others, but most importantly, to ourselves. 

The painful part of listening to this album is the feeling of finality.
There will never again be a Mac Miller album that was wholly - or even
partially - designed by him.
The circle is often seen as a symbol of permanence and immortality, like
the Ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail) in Greek mythology. So, it's only
fitting that the album to solidify his legacy in our minds is Circles.

Circles feels like a realisation that life isn't a comedy but it's more
of a tragedy with comic relief. True maturity is welcoming that reality
but recognising that sometimes the best you can do is keep Swimming in Circles.
