# Debt Destroyer

Debt Destroyer takes a list of all your debts with interest rates and minimum payments and will chart the time it will take you to pay off your debts

Additionally, you may add any extra funds you can contribute to your debt each month and that will be added to your monthly contributions.

If you pay off a debt mid-cycle it will automatically roll the remainder of your available funds into the next debt.

Debt payoff order is determined using the 'snowball' (lowest balance first) and 'avalanche' (highest rate first).
