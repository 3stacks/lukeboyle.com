# Vices

[2.0 is out now](https://vices.me)

I made Vices because I was spending way too much money on iced coffee and I needed a way to motivate myself to quit.

The new version adds a compound interest calculator to project how much your vice will impact you 10 years down the road (assuming you stop throwing your money in the trash and start throwing it into investments).
