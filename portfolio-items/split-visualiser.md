# Split Visualiser

*   Vue.js
*   Node.js
*   Babel, Webpack

Split Visualiser was the first app to be published under the [Stak Digital](https://stak.digital) brand and it was developed during a particularly intense gym fascination period. It was partly an experiment to determine the feasibility of Vue 2.0 for smaller projects and to see performance could scale as complexity increases.

Selecting exercises will highlight muscle groups based on their utilisation, allowing you to gauge how effective your split is.
